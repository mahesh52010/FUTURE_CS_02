                                   SIEM-Based Incident Monitoring and Analysis




📌 Overview

This repository contains the deliverables and documentation for Task 2: SIEM-Based Incident Monitoring and Analysis, completed as part of my Cybersecurity Internship (Track Code: FUTURE_CS_01).

Using Splunk, I analyzed simulated Windows Event Logs to:

Detect brute force login attempts

Identify signs of account compromise

Classify incidents based on severity

Recommend remediation actions based on log patterns

🛠️ Tools & Environment

SIEM Tool: Splunk (Free Trial)

Logs: Custom-generated Windows Event Log samples

OS: Windows (log simulation), Splunk Web Interface

🔍 Key Topics Covered

Event Code Analysis (4625, 4624, 4634)

Detection of brute-force patterns

Splunk query writing and filtering

SOC-level alert triage and incident classification

🧠 Learning Outcomes

Gained hands-on experience with SIEM platforms

Learned how to query and filter log data

Understood the process of investigating and responding to potential security threats

📄 Report Summary

Multiple failed logins detected from specific IPs

Successful login occurred after several failures → indicates compromise

Incident classified as Brute Force and Account Compromise
